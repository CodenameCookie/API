# API

## Description
This repo showcases Betfair's API and how to use it. It will utilise the [abettor](https://github.com/phillc73/abettor) package in R to simplify using the API and the [betfairlightweight](https://github.com/liampauling/betfair) package in Python.

## Examples
* Examples in R can be found [here](https://github.com/betfair-datascientists/API/tree/master/R).
* A full tutorial in Python can be found [here](https://github.com/betfair-datascientists/API/blob/master/python/API%20Tutorial.ipynb)

## Usage
The Betfair API can be used to get current exchange data, create bets, check your account balance and is an integral component in creating an automated betting strategy on the Betfair exchange.
